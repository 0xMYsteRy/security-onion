## How to contribute to Security Onion

First, thanks for being a part of the Security Onion community!  We appreciate any and all contributions!

#### Mailing List
The biggest thing that we need help with right now is supporting users on the [security-onion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/security-onion).  Please see the [group guidelines](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/MailingLists).

#### QA
We ask for testing before we release updates.  Please join our [security-onion-testing group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/security-onion-testing) and help us avoid regressions!

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Security Onion**, and instead refer to [security](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/Security).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, send a detailed email to the [security-onion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/security-onion).  We'll triage the issue and then open a Github Issue if necessary.

#### **Are you looking for source code?**

* You can get the source for any of our packages by doing the following at a terminal (replacing PACKAGE-NAME with the name of the package that you want the source for):
```
apt-get source PACKAGE-NAME
```
Some of our packages have their own Github repos at [Security-Onion-Solutions](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions).

Packages are built and hosted at [https://launchpad.net/~securityonion/+archive/ubuntu/stable](https://launchpad.net/~securityonion/+archive/ubuntu/stable).

Docker images can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/u/securityonionsolutions/](https://hub.docker.com/u/securityonionsolutions/).  Dockerfiles used to build those Docker images can be found at [https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-docker](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-docker).

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Security Onion documentation?**

* If you want to add or make changes to the [wiki](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki), please send modifications to the [security-onion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/security-onion) and we'll review and post.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
